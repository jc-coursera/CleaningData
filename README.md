# Project: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, 
and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later 
analysis. The following are the required files: 

1) a tidy data set created by a file called run_analysis.R based on project requirement. 
   The data source is from:  
   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2) a link to a Github repository with run_analysis.R. 

3) a code book(CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work 
that is performed to clean up the data.
